##  Mindsets on Promoting Care & Preventing Harm 

### Take the quiz to find out how you help people!

How do you think about social change? People have different mindsets about how to address mental health, physical health, safety, and relationships.

We would like to invite you to take part in a research study that we are doing to understand goals and strategies about ways people consider more care and less harm in their surroundings. This study involves a survey that takes no more than 20 minutes to complete. There is no payment for participating. However, you can receive the score from your responses at the end of the study. This score is meant to reflect your preferred mindsets or views for creating change.
